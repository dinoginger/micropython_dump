# Project for 27016 Design-Build 1

## Short intro
It is planned that we have two separate projects: The main one **(which is this)**, where all the relevant for the microcontroller code (and a bit more) is stored, and a separate file which operates with data analysis/visualization. Most of the code described here would be of this project, as the second one is pretty simple :)
